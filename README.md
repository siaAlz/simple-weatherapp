#simple weatherapp
a very simple weather app to practice working with apis , and api calls.
using openweather api.

\*\*\* things that i have learned:

- got better understanding of how apis work.

* revisited useState , createContext , useContext.

* worked with handling errors .

* implemented a simple but quite smart loading indicator.

* helper and service functions got a little more comperhensive to me.
